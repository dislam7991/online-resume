    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When I’m not immersed in tech and coding, you can often find me breaking a sweat 
        at the gym, fine-tuning my strength and conditioning as a dedicated bodybuilder and 
        powerlifter. <br/><img src="./assets/images/Bench Thumbnail.jpg" height="200" alt="sitting on a bench press in the gym"/>
        <br/>
        Cooking is another passion of mine – from crafting high-protein meal 
        bowls to experimenting with creative flavors, I’m always in the kitchen exploring ways to nourish both body and soul.

        I’m also an avid photographer, with a love for capturing moments through portrait 
        photography and sharing my work with a respectable following I've built on Instagram. 
        My passion extends to editing, camera work, and videography for YouTube, where I enjoy 
        bringing stories to life.

        <br/>Balancing my lifelong curiosity with competitive online gaming 
        sessions and a good book, I find fulfillment in both the creative and disciplined 
        aspects of life. Life’s a grind – but it’s one I’m committed to mastering.</p>
